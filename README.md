# C-Dippy's TailaVainea
This is my fourth unity game project from the Udemy Course: Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D.


This game is a 2D Pixel Tilemap Game. Player controlls a character, C-Dippy, to overcome obstacles and monsters to reach the end in limited lives. There are also coins to earn and various terrains along the road, and the player can shoot arrows besides moving and jumping.
The game consists of 3 levels.


I have only uploaded the source files. The original images, sprites, and sound effects are downloaded from the course website.
